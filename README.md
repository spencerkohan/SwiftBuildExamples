# Swift Build Examples

This repository contains several examples of building Swift executables using the `swiftc` CLI.

Each folder contains the sources to be build, as well as a script `build.sh` which builds and runs the executable defined by those sources.

The following build environment was used developing these examples:

    Apple Swift version 5.0.1 (swiftlang-1001.0.82.4 clang-1001.0.46.5)
    Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0
